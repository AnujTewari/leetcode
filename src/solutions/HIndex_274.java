/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/
 *
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)
 * of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has
 * index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and
 * the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher
 * has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations
 * respectively.
 * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and
 * the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 *
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken
 * as the h-index.
 *
 * Hint:
 * 1. An easy approach is to sort the array first.
 * 2. What are the possible values of h-index?
 * 3. A faster approach is to use extra space.
